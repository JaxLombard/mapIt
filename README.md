# mapIt
A short script that takes the address copied to your clipboard and opens a google map page of it.
It also can use the adress from command line arguments
First it gets address from command line arguments using sys.argv
Then, if it doesn't have args it grabs whatever it copied to the clipboard
Last, it uses webbrowser.open to open a google maps url with the address on the back.
You are welcome to use this automation script!
I personally turned the file into an .exe on my desktop for easy access.
